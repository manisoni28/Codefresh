            android:text="The Chinese mathematician Sun-Tsu solved the problem of finding those integers x that leave remainders 2, 3, and 2 when divided by 3, 5, and 7 respectively. One such solution is x = 23; all solutions are of the form 23 + 105k for arbitrary integers k. The &quot;Chinese remainder theorem&quot; provides a correspondence between a system of equations modulo a set of pairwise relatively prime moduli (for example, 3, 5, and 7) and an equation modulo their product (for example, 105).\n The Chinese remainder theorem has two major uses. Let the integer n be factored as n = n1n2 nk, where the factors ni are pairwise relatively prime.\n1.The Chinese remainder theorem is a descriptive &quot;structure theorem&quot; that describes the structure of Zn as identical to that of the Cartesian product with componentwise addition and multiplication modulo ni in the ith component.\n2.This description can often be used to yield efficient algorithms, since working in each of the systems can be more efficient (in terms of bit operations) than working modulo n.\nLet n = n1n2 nk, where the ni are pairwise relatively prime. Consider the correspondence :-&gt;\na&lt;-&gt;(a1a2a3a4...ak),\nb&lt;-&gt;(b1b2b3b4...bk),then\n(a+b)%n&lt;-&gt;((a1+b1)%n1,.....,(ak+bk)%nk)\n(a-b)%n&lt;-&gt;((a1-b1)%n1,.....,(ak-bk)%nk)\n(a*b)%n&lt;-&gt;((a1*b1)%n1,.....,(ak*bk)%nk)"
